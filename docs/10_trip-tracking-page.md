### 3. Interactive Map

#### Routes
- **Planned Route**: Blue dashed line showing the planned path
- **Actual Route**: Thick line showing the actual path
  - üü¢ Green: If vehicle is on the correct route
  - üî¥ Red: If vehicle has deviated from the route

#### Map Markers
- üü¢ **Starting Point**: Large green marker
- üî¥ **End Point**: Large red marker
- üöõ **Current Location**: Vehicle marker with speed information
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Checkpoints**: Small warning markers

#### Vehicle Colors
- üü¢ **Green**: Compliant vehicle (speed + route + lock)
- üî¥ **Red**: Non-compliant vehicle (one or more violations)

## Interactive Features

## Technologies Used

### 1. Complex Data Structures

```typescript
interface Trip {
  // Route
  origin: EntryPoint;
  destination: EntryPoint;
  
  // Timing
  plannedStartTime: Date;
  estimatedArrival: Date;
  
  // Monitoring
  currentLocation: LatLng;
  currentSpeed: number;
  
  // Statistics
  distanceTraveled: number;
  remainingDistance: number;
}
```

### 2. Real-time Updates

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    updateTripData();
  }, 5000);
  
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);
```

### 3. Progress Calculation

```typescript
const calculateProgress = (trip: Trip): number => {
  const totalDistance = trip.totalDistance;
  const traveled = trip.distanceTraveled;
  return Math.round((traveled / totalDistance) * 100);
};
```

### 4. Vehicle Color Determination

```typescript
const getVehicleColor = (trip: Trip): string => {
  const isCompliant = trip.isOnRoute && 
                     trip.isSpeedCompliant && 
                     trip.isLockSecure;
  return isCompliant ? '#22c55e' : '#ef4444';
};
```

## Color and Symbol Guide

### Routes
- üîµ **Blue dashed line**: Planned route
- üü¢ **Thick green line**: Actual route (compliant)
- üî¥ **Thick red line**: Actual route (deviated)

### Vehicles
- üü¢ **Green dot**: Vehicle compliant with all laws
- üî¥ **Red dot**: Vehicle violating one or more laws
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning symbol**: Checkpoint

### Points
- üü¢ **Large green dot**: Starting point
- üî¥ **Large red dot**: End point

### Compliance
